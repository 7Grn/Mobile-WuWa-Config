## V2.8 Configs will be moved to Old Configs when Version 3.1 Launches.  
> - Configs for 3.0 will be streamlined into a more adaptive build, with one focused solely for stability and performance.  
> - Support for V2.8 Configs will still be available until the end of Version 3.0  
> - By Version 3.1, we'll fully transition to the [V3.x] Configs  
> Thank you for your support :)  

# Recent Changes:  
## December 27, 2025

> You need to have at least Mediatek Dimensity 8200 or Snapdragon 8s Gen 2 to be able to use Mobile Ray-Tracing Configs

```
Internal Storage/
└── Android/
    └── data/
        └── com.kurogame.wutheringwaves.global/
            └── files/
                └── UE4Game/
                    └── Client/
