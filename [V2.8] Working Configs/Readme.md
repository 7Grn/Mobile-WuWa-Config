## Possible Bug Notice
For those who use mobile data in gaming, there are some instances where the game auto-crashes on start when applied with config.  
Crashing happens when the login value gets stuck at either 5, 7 or 11.
To get around this, you may explore these options:  
1. Option 1: Connect to a Wi-Fi  
   -> Connect to any Wi-Fi available  
   -> In the login screen, tap the screen to login and look at the number at the BOTTOM-RIGHT  
   -> If it did increase from 0, you can turn on the Wi-Fi and continue playing on your mobile data  
2. Option 2: Restart Connection  
   -> Turn on airplane mode and wait 30 seconds (or 5 minutes)  
   -> Turn off airplane mode and turn on mobile data  
   -> Retry the game
